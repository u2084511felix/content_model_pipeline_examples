## Introduction: The Global Surge of Executive Aggrandizement (2024–2025)

The years 2024 and 2025 have marked a watershed in the global contest over liberal democracy. Across continents, elected leaders have increasingly turned to executive aggrandizement—a process by which those in power incrementally or rapidly erode institutional checks and balances, often under the guise of legal or popular mandates. Unlike classic coups, this new wave of democratic backsliding is characterized by its gradualism, legalistic veneer, and the central role of incumbents who exploit institutional weaknesses to consolidate authority. The phenomenon is not confined to any single region or ideology; it is a global trend, with cases ranging from the United States and Hungary to Tunisia and West Africa.

This article provides a comparative analysis of the most significant recent cases of democratic backsliding, focusing on the mechanisms, enablers, and sources of resistance to executive aggrandizement. Drawing on fresh evidence from the United States, Hungary, Poland, Tunisia, Brazil, India, and West Africa, we dissect how leaders have undermined checks and balances, politicized institutions, and restricted civic space. We also highlight the critical role of civil society, the judiciary, and international actors in resisting or reversing democratic erosion, offering key lessons for defending democracy in an era of mounting internal threats.

### A New Era of Democratic Threats

The contemporary threat to democracy is less about tanks in the streets and more about the slow, methodical dismantling of institutional safeguards from within. This shift demands new frameworks for understanding and countering autocratization.

## Defining Executive Aggrandizement: Mechanisms and Motives

Executive aggrandizement refers to the process by which elected leaders expand their own power at the expense of other branches of government, often through legal or quasi-legal means. Unlike overt coups, this form of democratic erosion is typically incremental, involving the manipulation of laws, the co-optation of oversight bodies, and the undermining of judicial independence. Leaders justify these actions as necessary for efficiency, national security, or the fulfillment of the popular will, but the cumulative effect is the hollowing out of liberal democratic norms.

The motives behind executive aggrandizement are varied but often converge on the desire for personal or partisan gain. Leaders may seek to entrench their rule, shield themselves and their allies from accountability, or reshape the political landscape to favor their ideological or economic interests. The process is frequently enabled by elite collusion, patronage networks, and financial backers who stand to benefit from weakened oversight and concentrated power.

### Legalism as a Tool of Autocracy

Modern autocrats increasingly use the law itself as a weapon, passing legislation that appears neutral but is designed to undermine opposition, restrict civil society, and entrench executive dominance.

> — Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, "How Democracies Die"

## Comparative Case Studies: Patterns and Variations in Democratic Backsliding

A comparative lens reveals both commonalities and divergences in how executive aggrandizement unfolds. In some countries, such as Hungary and India, the process has been gradual and institutionalized, with leaders leveraging legislative supermajorities to systematically weaken checks and balances. In others, like the United States under Trump’s second term, the approach has been more rapid and confrontational, marked by open attacks on the judiciary, civil service purges, and efforts to control election administration.

Regional context, the strength of civil society, and the resilience of institutions shape the trajectory and outcomes of backsliding. While Tunisia’s self-coup under Kais Saied led to swift authoritarian consolidation, Brazil and Poland have demonstrated that democratic recovery is possible when opposition forces unite and institutions push back. West Africa, meanwhile, presents a mixed picture, with some states succumbing to military coups and others, like Senegal, showing signs of resistance and renewal.

### Global Patterns, Local Variations

Despite the global trend, the specific tactics and speed of executive aggrandizement are shaped by national histories, legal frameworks, and the presence or absence of robust opposition.

## United States: Rapid Tactics and Institutional Resistance under Trump’s Second Term

As of November 2025, the United States is experiencing a period of acute democratic backsliding under President Donald Trump’s second term. The administration has pursued rapid executive aggrandizement, including attacks on judicial independence, purges of the civil service, and efforts to politicize federal agencies and election administration. These moves have been accompanied by rhetoric delegitimizing the press, civil society, and political opposition, raising alarms among scholars who warn that the U.S. could become the fastest autocratizing democracy in recent history without a coup.

Despite these threats, U.S. institutions have shown notable resilience compared to peer cases. The judiciary, while under pressure, has issued key rulings upholding constitutional norms, and civil society organizations have mobilized to defend voting rights and protest executive overreach. The decentralized nature of American federalism and the strength of independent media have provided additional bulwarks, though the long-term durability of these defenses remains uncertain in the face of sustained executive pressure.

### Institutional Pushback and Its Limits

While the U.S. judiciary and civil society have mounted significant resistance, the executive’s ability to exploit legal ambiguities and partisan divisions continues to test the resilience of American democracy.

> — Sarah Kendzior, political analyst

## Hungary and India: Institutionalized Control and Incremental Erosion

Hungary under Viktor Orbán and India under Narendra Modi exemplify the slow, methodical erosion of democracy through institutionalized executive control. In Hungary, Orbán’s Fidesz party has used legislative supermajorities to rewrite the constitution, capture the judiciary, and stifle independent media. The result is a hybrid regime where elections persist but meaningful competition and oversight have been hollowed out.

India’s trajectory under Modi has been marked by the use of sedition laws, restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, and the politicization of law enforcement agencies. While formal democratic structures remain, the space for dissent has narrowed, and the independence of key institutions has been compromised. Both cases illustrate how executive aggrandizement can proceed incrementally, often with the tacit support of elites and segments of the public who are mobilized by ideological or nationalist narratives.

### The Power of Incrementalism

By moving gradually and using legal mechanisms, leaders in Hungary and India have avoided the international backlash that often accompanies more overt power grabs.

> — Freedom House, 2025 report

## Tunisia: The Self-Coup and Collapse of Checks and Balances

Tunisia, once hailed as the lone success story of the Arab Spring, has experienced a dramatic reversal since President Kais Saied’s self-coup in 2021. By suspending parliament, dismissing the government, and ruling by decree, Saied dismantled the country’s system of checks and balances. Over the past two years, this authoritarian consolidation has deepened, with the judiciary purged, opposition leaders jailed, and civil society organizations harassed or shuttered.

The international community’s response to Tunisia’s democratic collapse has been muted, with limited sanctions or diplomatic pressure. This has emboldened Saied’s regime and sent a chilling message to other would-be autocrats in the region. Tunisia’s experience underscores the dangers of complacency and the speed with which democratic gains can be reversed in the absence of robust institutional and societal resistance.

### The Cost of International Inaction

The lack of meaningful external pressure has allowed Tunisia’s autocratization to proceed largely unchecked, highlighting the limits of international democracy promotion in the current era.

> — Amna Guellali, Human Rights Watch

## Brazil and Senegal: Judicial Pushback and Civil Society Mobilization

In contrast to entrenched backsliding elsewhere, Brazil and Senegal have emerged as recent examples of democratic resilience. Following Jair Bolsonaro’s defeat in 2022, Brazil’s Supreme Court played a pivotal role in countering attempts to subvert the election results, while civil society organizations mobilized to defend electoral integrity and civil liberties. The new government has since taken steps to restore judicial independence and reverse anti-democratic policies.

Senegal’s 2024 transition further illustrates the power of institutional and societal resistance. When outgoing President Macky Sall attempted to delay elections, the Constitutional Court intervened to uphold the electoral calendar, and mass protests pressured the government to respect democratic norms. The successful transfer of power to President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has offered hope for democratic renewal in West Africa, even as the region faces mounting authoritarian pressures.

### The Role of Courts and Protest

Where institutions are willing to assert their independence and citizens are prepared to mobilize, even entrenched executive overreach can be reversed.

> — International IDEA, 2025

## West Africa: Military Coups and the Erosion of Democratic Norms

West Africa has witnessed a troubling resurgence of military coups and democratic erosion in recent years. In countries like Benin, President Patrice Talon has systematically constrained civil society and judicial independence, while in others, such as Mali and Burkina Faso, military juntas have seized power outright. These developments reflect both the fragility of democratic institutions and the willingness of elites to circumvent constitutional norms for personal or factional gain.

Despite these setbacks, there are pockets of resistance and hope. Senegal’s recent transition and Zambia’s constitutional reforms demonstrate that democratic renewal is possible, even in challenging environments. The region’s experience underscores the importance of vigilant civil society, independent judiciaries, and international support in countering the tide of authoritarianism.

### Cycles of Erosion and Renewal

While coups and executive overreach have set back democracy in much of West Africa, recent successes in Senegal and Zambia show that institutional and societal pushback can still make a difference.

## Elite Collusion, Patronage Networks, and Financial Backers: The Hidden Enablers

The erosion of democracy is rarely the work of a single leader. Elite collusion, patronage networks, and financial backers play a critical enabling role, providing the resources, legitimacy, and cover needed for executive aggrandizement. In countries like Peru, Guatemala, and El Salvador, business elites and corporate interests have supported anti-democratic actors in exchange for favorable policies and protection from accountability.

These networks often operate behind the scenes, using campaign finance, media ownership, and informal influence to shape political outcomes. Their support can be decisive in tipping the balance between democratic resilience and authoritarian consolidation, as seen in the ability of ruling parties in Hungary and India to maintain legislative dominance and suppress dissent. Exposing and disrupting these networks is essential for any strategy aimed at defending liberal democracy.

### The Business of Autocracy

Corporate and financial interests often align with executive power, creating a mutually reinforcing cycle of influence and impunity.

> — Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2025

## Ideological Narratives and the Politicization of Institutions

Ideology is a powerful tool in the hands of would-be autocrats. By framing executive aggrandizement as a defense of national sovereignty, traditional values, or the popular will, leaders can mobilize public support and delegitimize opposition. In Hungary, Orbán has used anti-immigrant and nationalist rhetoric to justify constitutional changes, while in India, Modi’s government has invoked Hindu nationalism to marginalize dissent and reshape state institutions.

The politicization of institutions extends beyond rhetoric. Leaders have systematically appointed loyalists to key positions, undermined the independence of the judiciary and media, and weaponized state agencies against critics. These tactics not only entrench executive power but also erode public trust in democratic institutions, making it harder for opposition forces to mount effective resistance.

### The Weaponization of Identity

By exploiting identity politics and cultural divisions, autocrats can fracture opposition and build durable coalitions in support of illiberal rule.

## Sources of Democratic Resilience: Lessons from Poland, Brazil, Senegal, and South Korea

While the global trend is worrisome, recent cases of democratic recovery offer important lessons. In Poland, the defeat of the Law and Justice (PiS) party in 2023 paved the way for a new government committed to restoring judicial independence and repairing relations with the European Union. Civil society mobilization and opposition unity were crucial in overcoming years of institutional erosion.

South Korea’s Constitutional Court provided another example of institutional resilience when it rejected President Yoon’s martial law declaration in December 2024, upholding the rule of law in the face of executive overreach. These cases, along with the experiences of Brazil and Senegal, demonstrate that judicial resistance, civil society activism, and international support can halt or even reverse democratic backsliding, provided they are mobilized early and sustained over time.

### The Power of Unity and Early Action

Opposition unity and early, coordinated resistance are key to preventing the consolidation of authoritarian power.

> — Polish Ombudsman’s Office, 2024

## International Pressure: The Role of Sanctions, Diplomacy, and Transnational Solidarity

International actors can play a significant, though often limited, role in defending democracy. In Poland, the European Union’s use of funding conditionality was instrumental in pressuring the government to restore judicial independence. Conversely, the lack of meaningful external intervention in Tunisia allowed Kais Saied’s autocratization to proceed largely unchecked, highlighting the uneven impact of international pressure.

Transnational solidarity, including support from diaspora communities, international NGOs, and multilateral organizations, can bolster domestic resistance and provide resources for embattled civil society groups. However, the effectiveness of sanctions and diplomatic pressure depends on the willingness of major powers to prioritize democratic norms over strategic or economic interests.

### Limits and Opportunities

While international actors can tip the balance in favor of democracy, their influence is constrained by geopolitical realities and the resolve of domestic elites.

> — European Commission, 2025

## Key Lessons and Strategies for Democratic Defense

The comparative analysis of recent cases yields several key lessons for defending liberal democracy. First, early intervention is critical; the longer executive aggrandizement proceeds unchecked, the harder it becomes to reverse. Second, judicial independence and civil society mobilization are indispensable pillars of democratic resilience. Where these actors are strong and coordinated, they can slow or even halt backsliding.

Third, exposing and disrupting elite collusion and patronage networks is essential for preventing the entrenchment of authoritarian rule. Finally, international support—while not a panacea—can provide crucial leverage, especially when aligned with domestic resistance. Proactive strengthening of democratic institutions, vigilance against complacency, and the cultivation of broad-based opposition coalitions are necessary to safeguard democracy in the face of mounting internal threats.

### From Warning to Action

The global trend of executive aggrandizement is a warning, but also a call to action for those committed to defending liberal democracy.

> — DemocracyDefender Editorial Board, 2025

## Conclusion: Early Intervention and the Future of Liberal Democracy

Executive aggrandizement has emerged as the central mechanism of democratic backsliding in the contemporary era, with leaders in diverse contexts using both rapid and incremental strategies to undermine checks and balances. The cases examined here demonstrate that while the threat is real and growing, democratic resilience and recovery are possible. Judicial resistance, civil society mobilization, opposition unity, and international pressure have all played decisive roles in halting or reversing backsliding in countries like Poland, Brazil, Senegal, and South Korea.

The future of liberal democracy depends on the willingness of institutions and citizens to recognize early warning signs and act decisively. Complacency is not an option; the lessons of 2024–2025 show that proactive defense, transparency, and the disruption of elite collusion are essential. As the global struggle over democracy intensifies, the need for vigilance, solidarity, and innovation in democratic defense has never been greater.

### A Roadmap for Democratic Renewal

By learning from both failures and successes, democracies can build more robust defenses against internal threats and chart a path toward renewal.
